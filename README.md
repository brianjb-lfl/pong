## Solo version of the 1972 Atari classic that started it all!

**Directions:**
* Move your mouse into the field to take control of the paddle (cursor will disappear).
* As play goes on, the ball will speed up.
* Striking the ball near the top or bottom edge of the paddle will result in a sharper and more difficult return.
